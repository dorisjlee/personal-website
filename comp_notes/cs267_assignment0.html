				I am a third-year undergraduate student in physics and astronomy. I work on astrophysical fluid simulation of young stars 
				using the NERSC's supercomputers. My current research interests are in large scale data mining and human computer interaction.
				From this class, I hope to learn about data-intensive computing and how to deal with large-scale datasets in a distributed manner.

			<h4>Star Formation Supercomputer simulations</h4>
			<p>The collapse of a molecular cloud is one of the first steps in star formation. Dense regions of molecular clouds of about 0.1 parsecs in size are active regions of low-mass star formation. These objects are shrouded by dust so they can only be observed in the IR wavelength. Dense cores are commonly found along gravitationally-bound filament structures. Cores gradually accrue mass from its relatively quiescent environment and evolve quasistaically through the drift between neutral particles and ions in the process of ambipolar diffusion. When the core’s mass reaches a critical value, it becomes marginally-unstable state and any perturbation results in gravitational collapse. As gas accretes onto the central region, a central hydrostatic object forms to become what would eventually become a star.
			
			<p>Recent spectroscopic studies of infall signatures in collapsing dense cores show that only region very close to the newly formed protostar have supersonic velocities. However, studies ranging from analytical to semi-analytical calculations to full simulations dedicated to this problem have shown that the supersonic transition occurs at a much larger radius away from the central star. In addition, most simulations are unable to form disks and suffer from artificial effects of fragmentation. The detailed physics of magnetized infall and the role of the magnetic field support against collapse are still controversial topics in the field. Since young stars are shrouded by dust and evolve on a relatively long timescales (~Myrs), astronomer can not observe the collapse to happen in action. 

			<p> Currently, the NERSC computers (Edison, Cori) are used to conduct a set of star formation simulation based on a recently-developed theoretical model and a set of realistic initial condition for simulating the collapse of a dense molecular cloud core.  The simulation uses the grid-based magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code RAMSES for tracking the evolution of a marginally-unstable cloud core with magnetic the detailed magnetic process and rotation.  Other commonly-used fluid codes for simulating astrophysical objects are <a href="https://trac.princeton.edu/Athena/"> Athena </a>, <a href="flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/"> FLASH </a> and <a href="enzo-project.org"> Enzo </a>.

			<p> RAMSES is a publically-available hydrodynamics, MHD code used for cosmological simulations.[1] While RAMSES is developed and mostly used for studying large scale structures, there has been existing studies using both RAMSES for studying low-mass star formation collapse problem. In star formation collapse problems, fixed grid spacing cannot fully represent accreting mass flows, since much of the mass collapsing into the central region are unresolved on a fixed grid.[2] A common way to overcome this problem is through the use of a sink particle to keep track of the mass and momentum flowing into the central region. This information is useful for computing the luminosity of the embedded protostar, however, these quantities are stored as a single scalar value and the full dynamics of the central region is not resolved.

			<p> The code makes use of adaptive mesh refinement, which effectively puts finer grids around areas of interest and coarser grids other regions. This functionality is integrated with load balancing for MPI communication. RAMSES can be run single-threaded, with MPI enabled. There is also a version of RAMSES parallelized by OpenMP directives and a GPU accelerated version.
